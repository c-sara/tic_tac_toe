# tic_tac_toe

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS and Javascript were used to piece together this game of Tic Tac Toe.

## Approach Taken
### Planning
Our first project was to be completed in roughly two days. I knew that planning out the process would be essential - it would help with tracking for the project and keep me focused at one task at a time. One of my goals for project 1 , and for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course was to make my code readable.

### During the project
Roadblocks would continue to pop up during the coding process. During these times I would write down the issue on paper and brain storm possible solutions. I attempted to break down each section into basic steps rather than focusuing on a bigger picture.

I would consult the instructor if I spent too much time on a problem for guidance on my thinking process due to the time constraint.
