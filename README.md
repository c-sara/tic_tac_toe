## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS and Javascript were used to piece together this game of Tic Tac Toe.

## Approach Taken
### Planning
Our first project was to be completed in roughly two days. I knew that planning out the process would be essential - it would help with tracking for the project and keep me focused at one task at a time. One of my goals for project 1 , and for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course was to maintain the readability of my code. It was important to me, as it would be easier to troubleshoot if there were any bugs along the way.

For a more detailed breakdown of my plan prior to beginning the code, visit my Notion board at: https://irradiated-mars-448.notion.site/Plan-Project-1-2219cc4572c94471ba49e1f54a5b471e (Shows my brainstorming for steps into making an interactive tic tac toe game and a sketch of my design).

### During the project
Roadblocks would continue to pop up during the coding process. As this was my first project, I was caught up in thinking too far ahead with where I wanted my project to go. I would consult my instructors for guidance on my ideas and any issues I was unable to resolve myself. They provided advice on how to break down problems and resolve them step by step. I took on their advice and learnt that it was valuable to stick to one idea at a time in order to complete each goal in the project.

### Making the best out of it
Initally the dog and cat images were placeholders in my game - I had wanted to change it to a "better" theme once an idea would come to mind. However, there were time contraints, it would have been too time consuming to switch the theme. Instead, I made the best out of what I had. 

I identified an issue with my original game where it was unclear who's turn it was or who had actually won the game. Adding in a pulsing animation made it clearer, as well as a winner's animation and randomised losing message.

In the end, I was very happy with where my project ended up. A lot of character was added into the game with small touches. I have been linking the game to my friends and family since completing it.

## Unsolved Problems
* Getting the code to work without hardcoding the X's and O's in my winning conditionals.

Futher below are unsolved problems due to time constraints:
* Allowing each play to select their character and changing the pieces on the board to reflect their choice
* Formatting the game to fit on browser/phone
